# Our company recently acquired a new company that had a very large dinosaur population (for a very low price...)
# We need to send these recently imported users (who have many dinos) a welcome email that 
# has a reset password token, to their new user accounts in our system.
# One caveat is that we have to send them in small bathces, so our email doesn't get blacklisted.
# We will send a batch of emails and wait every 10 minutes before we send another batch out.
# Given the following (not so great ðŸ¤“) code, please refactor this how you best see fit, without changing the behavior of the code.
